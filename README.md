# mezzanine-open-bmc

This project contains the kicad files for the BMC project.

##Project Status
* _Schematic:_ Complete. Would be wise to have a quick review (just to be safe :) ).
* _PCB:_ Connected. DRC appears to throw some small issues, once resolved gerber files can be produced.
* _Footprints:_ Some footprints have been added to the project.

__NOTE:__ There is some strangeness between the schematic and PCB; the ratsnest shows incorrect connections in the PCB so be sure to refer to the schematic when connecting components.
